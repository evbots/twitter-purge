# twitter-purge ðŸ§¹

**Twitter purge** automatically deletes old tweets from your timeline.

## IMPORTANT ðŸš¨ðŸš§

This product is still in development. Use at your own risk. Deleting Tweets is irreversible. 

---
## Getting Started

1. Sign up and create a project on the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/)
1. Create a new Project and App (select any environment). **Make sure to save your API keys!**
1. Set up 'User authentication settings'
    * App Permissions: Read and Write
    * Type of App: Confidential 
    * Enter any Callback URI and Website URL (e.g. this Github repo). *We're not using this.*
    * No need to save Client Id & Secret. *We're not using this.*
1. Go to your 'Keys and Tokens' > Generate Access Token & Secret
1. go to Keys and tokens to (re-)generate Access Token and Secret. **Make sure to save these keys!**
1. Make sure that after generation your Access Token & Secret are created with read and write permissions 
1. Save the keys to your `.env` file

**NOTE:** The App runs on the Twitter account that you've used to create the developer account & API keys. 

### Configure 

Your `.env` should be placed in the root of this project and contain the following keys.

```
TWITTER_API_KEY=''
TWITTER_API_SECRET=''
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=''
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=''
```

### Settings

The root of this project contains a settings file to configure the purge.

The default should be something like
```
"since_id": null,
"purge_after": 180,
"whitelist": [
    "tweet_id"
]
```

- `since_id` gets updated after each run
- `purge_after` is the amount of days that tweets get deleted. Please note that the Twitter API limit is capped at 3200. Depending on how often you tweet, this could affect the purge.
- `whitelist` is a list of tweet ids to you want to keep. Even if it passed your purge date.

### Cron Job

The cron job in `.github/workflows` will automatically run on daily basis. Make sure to configure [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with the same variables as your `.env` file.
